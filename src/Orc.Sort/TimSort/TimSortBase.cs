// Java implementation:
//
// A stable, adaptive, iterative mergesort that requires far fewer than
// n lg(n) comparisons when running on partially sorted arrays, while
// offering performance comparable to a traditional mergesort when run
// on random arrays.  Like all proper mergesorts, this sort is stable and
// runs O(n log n) time (worst case).  In the worst case, this sort requires
// temporary storage space for n/2 object references; in the best case,
// it requires only a small constant amount of space.
// 
// This implementation was adapted from Tim Peters's list sort for
// Python, which is described in detail here:
// http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt
// 
// Tim's C code may be found here:
// http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listobject.c
// 
// The underlying techniques are described in this paper (and may have
// even earlier origins):
// 
// "Optimistic Sorting and Information Theoretic Complexity"
// Peter McIlroy
// SODA (Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms),
// pp 467-474, Austin, Texas, 25-27 January 1993.
// 
// While the API to this class consists solely of static methods, it is
// (privately) instantiable; a TimSort instance holds the state of an ongoing
// sort, assuming the input array is large enough to warrant the full-blown
// TimSort. Small arrays are sorted in place, using a binary insertion sort.
